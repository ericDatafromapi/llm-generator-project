# 🎉 Production Deployment - All Issues Resolved!

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Registration - WORKING ✅
**Problem:** Backend returned only user object, no tokens  
**Fix:** Modified registration endpoint to return tokens  
**Result:** Users auto-login after registration

### 2. Generation - WORKING ✅
**Problems Found (step by step):**
- Celery worker not listening to "generation" queue
- Worker PATH didn't include Docker

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added `-Q generation,scheduled` to worker service
- Fixed PATH to include system binaries: `/usr/bin:/usr/sbin`
  
**Result:** File generation completes successfully!

### 3. Subscription - WORKING ✅
**Problem:** No webhook endpoint configured in Stripe  
**Fix:** Configured webhook in Stripe Dashboard  
**Result:** Subscriptions update correctly (confirmed in database)
