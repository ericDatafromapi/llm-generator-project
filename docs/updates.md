I need to take a few things into account and would like you to help me make the updates.
Depending on the size of the user's website using the platform, they will not be able to use all the files on their website. I want you to add some guidelines to the generations page like this 

1. Recommendation Logic
Create a simple function that takes page count and file size, returns one of three recommendations:

"minimal" (just llms.txt)
"standard" (llms.txt + llms-full.txt)
"complete" (llms.txt + folder structure)

Minimal (≤50 pages, <2MB) -> "minimal"
Standard (50-500 pages, <10MB) -> "standard"
Complete (>500 pages or ≥10MB) -> "complete"

2. UI After Generation Completes
Small card showing:

Stats summary
One-line recommendation about which files to upload
Button to see more deployment tips

3. Simple Tips Modal
When user clicks for more info, show:

Why you recommend those specific files for their site
Basic steps: download, unzip, upload to root
Note that they're free to do whatever they want

4. API Response Update (You can skip this if not applicable or not necessary)
Add the stats and recommendation to the generation completion response
