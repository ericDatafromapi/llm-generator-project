# ‚úÖ Week 7: Website Management - COMPLETE

**Status**: Implementation Complete ‚úÖ  
**Date Completed**: October 14, 2025  
**Test Status**: Ready for Testing

---

## üéâ What's Been Implemented

### Core Features
- ‚úÖ **Website CRUD**: Complete create, read, update, delete operations
- ‚úÖ **Plan-Based Limits**: Automatic enforcement of website limits by subscription tier
- ‚úÖ **Website Statistics**: Per-website and user-wide analytics
- ‚úÖ **Generation History**: Enhanced filtering in existing endpoint
- ‚úÖ **URL Validation**: Automatic URL normalization and duplicate detection
- ‚úÖ **Pattern Management**: Include/exclude patterns for crawling
- ‚úÖ **Active/Inactive Toggle**: Enable/disable websites without deletion

### API Endpoints (8 endpoints)
1. `POST /api/v1/websites` - Create new website
2. `GET /api/v1/websites` - List websites (paginated, filtered)
3. `GET /api/v1/websites/{id}` - Get website details
4. `PUT /api/v1/websites/{id}` - Update website
5. `DELETE /api/v1/websites/{id}` - Delete website
6. `GET /api/v1/websites/{id}/stats` - Get website statistics
7. `GET /api/v1/websites/stats/user` - Get user statistics
8. `GET /api/v1/generations/history` - Generation history (already exists, now enhanced)

### Plan-Based Limits Enforced
| Plan | Max Websites | Max Pages/Site |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| Free | 1 | 100 |
| Standard | 5 | 500 |
| Pro | Unlimited (999) | 1000 |

## üì¶ Files Created/Modified

### Created (2 files)
- [`backend/app/schemas/website.py`](backend/app/schemas/website.py:1) - Pydantic schemas (125 lines)
- [`backend/app/api/v1/websites.py`](backend/app/api/v1/websites.py:1) - API endpoints (412 lines)

### Modified (1 file)
- [`backend/app/main.py`](backend/app/main.py:14) - Added website routes

---

## üöÄ How It Works

### Website Creation Flow

```
1. User submits website creation request
   ‚Üì
2. POST /api/v1/websites
   - Check subscription plan
   - Enforce website limits
   - Validate URL format
   - Check for duplicates
   - Enforce max_pages limit
   ‚Üì
3. Create website record
   - Auto-normalize URL
   - Set default values
   - Update subscription count
   ‚Üì
4. Return website details
```

### Plan Limit Enforcement

```python
# Automatic checks:
- Free users: Can create 1 website max
- Standard users: Can create 5 websites max
- Pro users: Unlimited websites (999)

# Max pages also enforced:
- Free: 100 pages max per site
- Standard: 500 pages max per site
- Pro: 1000 pages max per site
```

- ‚úÖ JWT authentication on all endpoints
- ‚úÖ User can only access their own websites
- ‚úÖ Plan-based access control
- ‚úÖ URL validation and sanitization
- ‚úÖ Duplicate prevention
- ‚úÖ Cascading deletes (website ‚Üí generations)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Website limit reached"

**Cause:** User has reached their plan's website limit

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check current plan
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/subscriptions/current" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Upgrade plan if needed
# Or delete unused websites
```

### Issue: "Duplicate URL" error

**Cause:** User already has a website with that URL

**Solution:**
```bash
# List existing websites
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/websites" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Use a different URL or update existing website
```

### Issue: Can't delete website

**Cause:** Website has active generations

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check generation status
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/generations/history?website_id=$WEBSITE_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Wait for generations to complete or fail
# Then retry deletion
```

## üìà Statistics Explained

### Website Statistics
- **total_generations**: All generations ever created for this website
- **successful_generations**: Completed generations
- **failed_generations**: Failed generations
- **success_rate**: (successful / total) √ó 100
- **last_generation_at**: Most recent successful generation

### User Statistics
- **total_websites**: All websites (active + inactive)
- **active_websites**: Websites with `is_active = true`
- **total_generations**: All generations across all websites
- **generations_this_month**: Count since current billing period start
- **generations_remaining**: Quota left for this month

---

## üéØ Integration with Generation System

### Starting a Generation

```bash
# 1. Create website
WEBSITE_RESPONSE=$(curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/websites" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com", "name": "Example"}')

WEBSITE_ID=$(echo $WEBSITE_RESPONSE | jq -r '.id')

# 2. Check quota
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/generations/quota/check" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# 3. Start generation
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/generations/start" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"website_id\": \"$WEBSITE_ID\"}"

# 4. View statistics after completion
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/websites/$WEBSITE_ID/stats" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
