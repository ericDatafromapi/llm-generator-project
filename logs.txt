Flexible billing mode changes proration, usage billing, trials, invoicing, and supports mixed intervals.

TLDR

Flexible mode aligns billing to actual debits and reporting times, cleans up invoices, standardizes trials, includes pending items consistently, and enables mixed-interval subscriptions. It’s recommended, but behaviors differ from classic in prorations, usage handling, cycle anchors, and schedule transitions.

Key differences and impacts
 • Credit prorations: Flexible calculates credits from the original debited amount; classic recalculates from current price, tax, quantity, discounts.
 • Discounts on prorations: Flexible applies discounts proportionally per item; classic spreads evenly.
 • Usage-based pricing:
 ▫ No zero-amount line items when adding usage items; empty invoices aren’t generated.
 ▫ Bills usage at the price effective when the usage was reported (e.g., earlier usage at old price, later usage at new price).
 ▫ On removal mid-period, may create invoice items for unbilled usage based on proration_behavior; consolidated single invoice at phase transitions.
 • Billing cycle anchor: Flexible never auto-resets; only resets if you explicitly set billing_cycle_anchor.
 • Scheduled cancellation: Flexible can disable prorations for a truncated first period via proration_behavior.
 • Backdating: Flexible splits into separate line items per billing period and aligns the anchor to backdate_start_date; limited to 250 line items max.
 • Trials:
 ▫ Uses the most recent trial_start.
 ▫ Preserves trial_end when cancel_at changes.
 ▫ Standardizes trial line item descriptions across item types and localizes them.
 ▫ Only generates line items for changes during a trial; doesn’t rebill unchanged items.
 • Pending invoice items: Flexible always includes pending items on invoices, including anchor-reset invoices with always_invoice.
 • Mixed intervals: Flexible supports mixed interval subscriptions (e.g., monthly + annual) within one subscription; classic doesn’t.

Practical migration notes

Expect more precise credits, price-at-reporting usage charges, cleaner invoicing with consolidation, explicit control of cycle anchors, and standardized trial handling. Review proration_behavior in updates, removals, and schedule transitions, and test backdating limits and mixed-interval scenarios.
